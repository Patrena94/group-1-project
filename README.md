# group-1-project
The team consists of Ryan Szczepanski, Katrine Collins, and Patrena Smith, also known as KC, RS, and PS for note taking purposes. Our Serve-side APIs challenge is: A responsive webpage that displays movie posters, release dates, a plot summary, and statistical data about the movieâ€™s popularity. The repository was set up by KC and cloned by RS and PS.  The files were established and pushed to Github by PS.  The group worked together to choose the open movie database (ombdapi.com) to the JS file. RS was assigned to identify and add the Wikipedia. KC and PS worked on the search box design functionality.
PS downloaded and modified the CV template form W-3 /* W3.CSS 4.15 December 2020 by Jan Egil and Borge Refsnes */
RS added the Wikipedia API to the project.  
The team worked on pulling and displaying data during class for the first API on Monday, July 6, 2021. KC was assigned to develop the presentation.  RS and PS are going to clean up the code and layout. 
PS removed the Wikipedia API, we were unable to obtain valuable information. PS replaced the Wikipedia API with the imdb API and established the data retrieval functionality.  PS then established local storage and extraction of data from the IMDB API to be displayed within the website.
PS affix IMBD logo as required by the contract to utilize the API. PS changed the layout of the website by changing the background and side bar color, and overall layout.  PS and KC worked on the language for the website. PS and KC worked on establishing a plan for deployment of the website.  

To utilize the website. The user will need to enter a name of a movie into the search field, then press the search movie button (submit). The search movie button initiates the serach for the movie in the OMD API then the IMD API.  The information is then process through the provide data and generate function to provide the necessary information requested in the Html.  The data of the search is stored in local starage via movie search.  The historySearch and function search movie are utilized to store and maintain the movie titles.
